## How to Use the New Features

### For Drivers (Chauffeurs):
1. Login or register as a driver
2. Navigate to "Espace Chauffeur"

   - Enter departure and arrival cities
   - **NEW**: Enter departure time (HH:MM format)
   - **NEW**: Enter arrival time (HH:MM format)
4. Times will be displayed in the taxi listing and visible to passengers

### For Admins (Administrateurs):
1. Register with a **strong code** (important for security!)
2. Login with your username
3. You'll be redirected to `/admin` which will show a code verification form
4. Enter your admin code
5. Once verified, you can:
   - Manage taxi approvals
   - View departure and arrival times
   - Manage fixed routes
   - Set pricing

### For Passengers (Passagers):

## Database Migration Note

⚠️ If you're updating an existing database:
- The schema upgrade functions in `routes.py` will automatically add the new columns
- No data migration needed
- Existing taxis will have NULL values for times (which will display as not shown)

---

## Security Notes

✅ **Admin Code Protection**: 
- Admin codes are now hashed with Werkzeug before being stored in the database
- Plain-text legacy admin codes are upgraded on first successful verification
- Code is verified on each admin panel access
- Session-based verification is still used for `/admin`

✅ **Upload Security**:
- Driver document uploads now only accept image and PDF extensions
- This prevents arbitrary scripts or executable files from being saved under `static/uploads`

⚠️ **Future Improvements**:
- Add session timeout for admin access
- Add audit log for admin actions
- Implement email verification for user registration
